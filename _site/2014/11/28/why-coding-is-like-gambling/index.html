<p>From what I understand, gamblers live for the thrill of the win. There is nothing more satisfying. And when they lose, they keep going even though they&rsquo;re hurting themselves because they know that that win is coming, and all the loss will feel okay when it happens (even if when it&rsquo;s all said and done they&rsquo;re in the red).</p>

<p>So how does it relate to coding?</p>

<p>You embark on some project, and all the progress you make is gratifying (the little wins) and then you reach a bug, and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve just lost and you won&rsquo;t stop until that damn bug is fixed. And sometimes that bug hurts; it consumes you. Hours have gone by, and you need to sleep, but you must find that bug and kill it! After that you&rsquo;ll settle your bets and go to bed. And then it happens - you find the bug! You feel relief, you&rsquo;ve finally won again!</p>

<p>But then you want more. You told yourself you&rsquo;d stop, but it felt so good and there&rsquo;s so much more to be won- this is where the fun begins again, maybe you&rsquo;ll get on a hot streak!</p>

<p>You get the point. Let&rsquo;s just be thankful we&rsquo;re usually gaining more than we lose :).</p>
