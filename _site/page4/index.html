    <div class="entry-content"><p>I can safely say that <a href= "http://www.deejbase.com">DeeJBase.com</a>, my baby, has grown up to be an awesome website. Here are some of my technical milestones over the past month. I have built:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A database with about 250 real NYC DJs with photos and demos from soundcloud.</p></li>
<li><p>A log-in system allowing human DJ&rsquo;s to claim and control their profiles through in invitation emailing system.</p></li>
<li><p>As of yesterday, I was able to use Facebook Graph to cross reference the majority of DJ&rsquo;s in my database with their facbook pages and pull in their number of likes and well as some other info.</p></li>
<li><p>A way of filtering through each DJ&rsquo;s tracks&#8217; taglists and finding genres to associate with each DJ based on key words in the tag lists of their tracks.</p></li>
<li><p>A cool design with a search feature and the ability to filter DJ&rsquo;s by genre and soundcloud followers.</p></li>
<li><p>A like button connected to my Deejbase facebook page.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of the site so far. And honestly it&rsquo;s been a pleasure - to have a vision and at first, have no idea how you are going to get from point a to point b and then building a scaffold, pouring over API documentation, figuring out algorithms on the back end to parse data. Automating something using code that would take a human countless tedious hours to do manually. Then when you feel like getting artsy, making some design changes on the front-end.</p>

<p>Full-stack web developement is amazing. I. love. it.</p>

<p>But now I need to get real and put on my business, lean-startup hat. As of two days ago, I had talked to a bunch of other (succesfull and unsuccesful) entrepreneurs for advice but hadn&rsquo;t really interfaced with many potential target customers (venues and event-planners hiring DJs). So that&rsquo;s what I started doing yesterday. I&rsquo;m going to write a separate post about that.</p>
