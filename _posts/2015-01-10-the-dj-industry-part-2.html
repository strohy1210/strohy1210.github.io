<div class="entry-content"><p>
So last night (a Friday) I did a little more field research, which ended in me partying in the basement of Bowery Electric.  Summary below:</p>

<p>Beauty Bar (dive on 14th st between 2nd and 3rd ave)
I roll in around 8:30 and talk to the older woman DJing (from 7-11pm). She says she used to spin every week there and now is only asked to spin once per month on the happy hour shift. She says for the 4 hours she works, she makes about $75- but it&rsquo;s not about the money, she does it ​because she loves it.</p>

<p>Bar 13 (sports bar on 9th and 2nd ave)
This bar is always filled with the &lsquo;I just turned 21 crowd&rsquo;. Cheap drinks and beer pong.  The DJ booth is this awful box at the end of the bar - you can barely see the guy. It&rsquo;s unlikely people know that there is a DJ. In fact, even though I&rsquo;d been there a number of times, I wasn&rsquo;t sure they ever hired one. I go up to talk to the DJ, his name&rsquo;s Anthony, and he says that he&rsquo;s making less than $200 for over <em>6 hours</em> of DJing. I ask him how he got hired and he says he knows the guy responsible for hiring the DJs be​c​ause they went to college together and that he&rsquo;s actually a tech recruiter by day (interesting). The DJ says the whole business is quite &ldquo;incestuous.&rdquo; You hire who you know. That&rsquo;s nothing new to me.</p>

<p>Solas(9th st between 2nd and 3rd ave)
I sit at the bar and ask the manager about how he hires DJs. He g​ets​ super cagey once I g​e​t to question 3. Anyway the DJ that spins there regularly is apparantly exclusively responsible for hiring any other DJs.</p>

<p>Whisky Town (~4th and 2nd ave)
The place is empty when I walk in around 10pm. I talk to one of the bartenders for a while- he&rsquo;s very nice. He tells me that one manager hires the DJs for all 4 of the bars, which are under the same management. There are the same people each Thurs, Fri and Sat that regularly spin. He says that if I were to get a job, they&rsquo;d require me to play &ldquo;top-40 generic kind of music just so I know &rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d be getting into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Keller AKA Von (Bowery and Bleaker)
The place is very crowded and people are having a good time.. I go up to the DJ and ask him how how much he charges​.​  He takes a beat and before he can answer, I say &ldquo;you&rsquo;d charge more for a private event th​a​n something like this&rdquo; he nods n agreement. He sa​ys​ he&rsquo;d charge anywhere from $500-1000 for a private party and hands me his card.</p>

<p>Bowery Electric (2nd and Bowery)
I was here most of the night and had a generally good time. ​People were dancing and​ for the most part,​ having a lot of fun. The DJ played mostly top-40, some older songs, some new pop songs that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with but the groups of 22 year olds were singing along to​. Just because someone plays the crowd-pleasers doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not going to enjoy it or that the DJ isn&rsquo;t good. But there are very obvious changes to how a DJ plays a progression of music that regardless of the song selection, distinguish a shitty DJ. And it baffles and hurts when someone in a position as a DJ at a crowded popular bar can&rsquo;t do that bear minimum. For example, the DJ regularly was playing almost the ENTIRE song. Like, it&rsquo;s fine that you played Katy Perry -Last Friday Night- I genuinely like that song but when you&rsquo;ve gotten to <em>the third verse </em> Seriously, the third verse, you&rsquo;ve done something wrong.</p>

<p>But then on the same token, it didn&rsquo;t really matter. People, for the most part, were having a blast. I had a good time dancing and singing along to few of the songs, whereas others made me want to go up there and smash her laptop. They made me genuinely angry.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think th​e majority of the crowd was as discerning as me.</p>

<p>What does this mean in terms of DeeJBase?</p>

<p>There are 2 types of people in this industry:<br>
1. Those who care about a crowded room where people are drinking and having fun. These people include, pretty much any bar manager, pretty much any DJ, and most consumers of DJ music and nightlife - people like you and me. This is what matters most in a general sense. This is why people stay out and drink and make the business possible.<br>
2. Then there are people who care not only about having a good time, about drinking and dancing, but about the art of DJing - that appreciate a DJ that doesn&rsquo;t just play &ldquo;crowd pleasers.&rdquo; And even if they stick with top-40, that they play that music in a way that make sense, that they transition seamlessly, that they don&rsquo;t keep the same song on for more than 2 minutes, that keeps us interested beyond the cheap shots.  Those people who care- who value <em>the art</em>, those are the people that I want to bring together - that need a voice. And those people include a subset of bar managers like those at Folly, VIP Room, and Madame X. A subset of nightlife consumers, like myself. And many, not all, but many DJs. Many DJs who have no gigs - who would also work for peanuts and deserve that rush that comes with seeing an elated crowd.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s who DeeJBase is for. It&rsquo;s for talented DJs, the venues who hire them, and the people who love them.</p>
