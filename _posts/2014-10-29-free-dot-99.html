<div class="entry-content"><p>How is rails free? How?!? It&rsquo;s amazing, the power being given to the average 4-week old programmer through frameworks like rails.

I can&rsquo;t create rails? I&rsquo;m only 4 weeks old. Look at me! Why do I deserve rails?
<br>
Ok, I literally just typed in my terminal: &ldquo;Why is rails free?&rdquo;
That wasn&rsquo;t helpful. Ok, how about&hellip; &ldquo;open source&rdquo;?</p>

<blockquote><p>In production and development, open source as a development model promotes a universal access via a free license to a product&#8217;s design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone.</p><footer><strong>[Wikipedia] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source]</strong></footer></blockquote>

<p>Good definition, but this still doesn&rsquo;t tell me why I get rails.
<br>
Down the rabbit hole again. Ok, here we go. Here is this engaging video from RSA animate, where I think the answer is put very simply and elegantly. I encourage you to watch it.</p>

<p>But in case you didn&rsquo;t, the answer to why open source software exists is in what motivates us. And reputable studies show that in certain circumstances (those in which we are performing at least somewhat creative, thoughtful activities), money is not the greatest motivator. Actually, too much money can discourage us. Afer a certian income level (where we are being paid enough to not worry tremendously about subsisting), what motivates us most is our desire for three things:</p>

<p><strong>1.Autonomy </strong> (our ability to be self-directed)<br>
<strong>2.Mastery  </strong>(desire to be be awesome at something)<br>
<strong>3.Purpose  </strong>(feeling that we are working toward a greater more transcendent goal than pure cash money dolla bills)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful, and I am comfortable with that explanation for why amazing open source software exists (at least for now). But seriously, just watch that video. Cheers!</p>
