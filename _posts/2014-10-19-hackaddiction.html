<div class="entry-content"><p>This past Saturday afternoon, I wrote my first useful command line program from scratch. It was really fun. Every time I got a new piece of code working the way I envisioned it would, I felt like superwoman. The program allows you to type in &ldquo;events&rdquo; in your command line then it prints out all the cool music events happening that night in Brooklyn and New York and their venues using a scrape from Resident Advisor.</p>

<p>And today, I was thinking about that program that I only stopped working on because I had to meet up with some friends and how I could keep making it better and I got excited about figuring out how I would do that. And I knew I had reading and homework I was supposed to do for school. And then it dawned on me - the blessing and curse of computer programming.</p>

<p>Your program can never stop getting more amazing.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself by saying that. I mean I know for sure that my programs are far from amazing as a programming newb.</p>

<p>But even after I got my program working the way that I wanted when I first set out to work on the project, I started thinking of ways to improve it. And maybe that I&rsquo;d finish those improvements today. And then I realize if I do that, I&rsquo;ll never actually get to my assignments and there&rsquo;s a lot more I should learn and should be devoting my time to that as well as being creative&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how I would turn my command line app into a web application. But it&rsquo;s so fun and validating to be able to create something- it&rsquo;s scary. I&rsquo;m incredibly powerful with my Ruby magic already. Imagine how powerful I&rsquo;ll be in a week, in 3 weeks. I just need to remember to stay humble and keep learning from the amazing programmers accessible to me at the Flatiron School.</p>
